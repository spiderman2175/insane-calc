# insane-gpcr
iPython3 notebook for calculating the INSertion ANglE of the Galpha C-terminal helix with respect to a GPCR membrane axis.

Returns the insertion angle and an NGLView instance showing the GPCR membrane axis vector (green), the vectors used to construct it (red) and the Galpha C-terminal helix vector (blue).

The membrane axis vector is defined as in GPCRdb (https://github.com/protwis/protwis/blob/master/tools/management/commands/build_structure_angles.py).
